Scientific databases are often the main source for searching scientific literature in various fields. The ever-increasing number of scientific documents makes finding information of interest more time-consuming. Metadata provided in database queries allows for accurate information retrieval. In this work, we present a tool that allows searching scientific publications in the IEEE Xplore database based on input metadata and additional analysis of obtained records.
